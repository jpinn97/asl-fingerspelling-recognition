\section{Introduction:}

\lettrine[lines=2]{T}{his} Individual Project documents the conceptualization and development of a machine learning model for translating American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling videos into text. The foremost aim of the project, part A, is to create a model that can interpret ASL fingerspelling video and predict the corresponding text to a realistic degree. Given the success of part A, a smaller secondary objective part B is to develop a user-friendly application that allows the user to input ASL fingerspelling videos and receive the corresponding text output. The project outcomes are two-fold, a machine learning model and a user-friendly proof-of-concept that serves academia.

The field of AI has seen rapid development in image and video recognition, however, the most prominently researched topics related to fingerspelling is automatic-speech-recognition (ASR). Interpreting sign language, gestures, and fingerspelling are even smaller niches, and development in these areas is lower. Leading figures such as Bowen Shi \cite{shiFingerspellingDetectionAmerican2021} provided the first attempts to recognize fingerspelling in "wild" environments.

Research for ASL fingerspelling recognition is lacklustre because of its niche topic, and small amount of overall ASL users worldwide, perhaps as high as 2 million \cite{mitchellHowManyPeople2006, ethnologueAmericanSignLanguage2023}. 

Furthermore, the complexity of ASL fingerspelling recognition which has a high degree of variability in hand shape, movement, and speed of signing, and much more characteristics makes recognition a challenging task. This requires a large dataset and a robust model to solve this task, and over the years created datasets are small, lack diversity, and are not developed realistically to a real-world environments.

The purpose of this project is to make use of emerging technologies and datasets in order to produce a model that can further the academic field, and improve accessibility for Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals. The idea is that for a lot of users fingerspelling is faster than typing on a keyboard or smartphone, and so could provide a means of alternative smoother communication between Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals, and technology. The model produced in this project will be a proof-of-concept, and will not be a final product, but will serve as a stepping stone for future research and development in the field. 

The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining \cite{hotzWhatCRISPDM2018}, is a widely used methodology for data mining and artificial intelligence projects. It involves 6 steps that in practice are iterative, and can be revisited at any time as needed. The steps are Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modelling, Evaluation, and Deployment.

Over the course of this document, we will document a literature review to discover our roots, following with the CRISP-DM methodology outlining our strategic and technical decisions. In here, expect to find a detailed explanation of the project's development, the model's architecture, and the application's design. We will also discuss the project's management, risks involves, milestones achieved, and state the achieved outcome of the project.

The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a widely used methodology that provides a structured approach to undertaking data science projects from a process perspective. In this task, we emphazise the usage of CRISP-DM methodology as a preferable process over a standalone software development methodology, this is because the project requires a higher level of management than a naive implementation that agile gives. Agile-like processes can be integrated into CRISP-DM with usages of rapid prototyping and usual backlogging, testing, etc, but found the CRISP-DM "pipeline" is adaptable to the real world goal of developing data science projects.

CRISP-DM is inherently iterative, it understands that whilst developing in say the evaluation phase, unexpected consequences allow us to move back to the data preparing or modelling phase to adjust. Furthermore, the feedback loops observed in \ref{fig:CRISP-DM Methdology} explicity accomadates returning to previous steps to refine insights. 

The 6 phases include business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment.

\subsection{Business Understanding}
The objective of the project is to increase accessibility for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community, and by developing artificial intelligent models, this would be achieved. In order to tackle this, we must understand if we have the ability to;

\subsection{Data Understanding}

Given our chosen dataset, we must explore the data we are working with. This includes the complexity of the data, in terms of size, shape, format, distribution, and quality. We need to model the data so we can understand the relationships between fields. The data was created using MediaPipe ****CITE*****, an open-source framework for creating AI pipelines, it contains various pre-trained models such as the MediaPipe Holistic Model https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/solutions/holistic.md that can label images and videos, for groups of the body such as hands, face, and pose.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/mediapipe.png}
    \caption{MediaPipe Framework Hand Landmarks \cite{IMAGE}}
    \label{fig:MediaPipe Framework}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:MediaPipe Framework} shows the mapping of landmarks for hands, which are points used to track the movemnt of the joints and important features, all groups have this structure.

The dataset consists of 121 parquet files, columnar-storage structure for large datasets that work in a distributed environment such as Hadoop. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/parquet_structure_1.png}
    \caption{Dataset Structure: train.csv}
    \label{fig:Dataset Structure}
\end{figure}

Referring to Figure \ref{fig:Dataset Structure}, the components of the dataset is primarily of sequence_id, which correlate to a signed phrase which is denoted by a seperate train.csv document. Each sequence_id groups a number of sequences or rows of frames. This grouping extends again as all the following columns are landmarks split into their x, y, z axis.


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/parquet_structure_2.png}
    \caption{Parquet File Structure}
    \label{fig:Parquet File Structure}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Parquet File Structure} shows us this is a sequential dataset. Exploring the dataset we see that the length of phrases are variable, as is the number of frames in each sequence. There are 1,629 spatial coordinates representing x, y, z for each of 543 landmarks represented by 'face', 'left_hand', 'pose', 'right_hand'. 

Additionally, there are a number of landmarks where values are missing, and for some large stretches of frames all values are missing, which denotes a potential corruption of recording or missing data. These missing values will need to be handled carefully in the data preparation phase. The variability of the data is a challenge, certain models in seq2seq tasks require fixed lengths for inputs and outputs, and the large variability is a trouble so truncation or interpolation along the time axis may be necessary. The sequence length would allow a larger range of temporal features to be extracted but would require a complex model and larger memory requirements.  The landmarks are of type float32, which is a 32-bit floating point number, this is typically high precision and default in PyTorch and TensorFlow, we may not require this level of precision and could downcast to float16 or another type to save memory and speed up computation.
