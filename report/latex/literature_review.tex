\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item why is this topic (ASL) important? (e.g., accessibility, communication)

          ASL ,
    \item what is the impact of an AI recognizer for this problem? (e.g., enables real-time communication, improves accessibility, etc.) (can this effect broader technology?)
\end{itemize}

Sign language is the primary form of communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community. It allows communication when the spoken language is not possible, and or when the speaker or receiver is deaf or hard of hearing.
Depending on the situation, and like any language, it requires both parties to be fluent in the language to communicate effectively. However, this is not always the case. American Sign Language(ASL) is a complete, complex language that employs signs made with the hands and other movements, including facial expressions and postures of the body, and is used natively in the
United States of America and globally by many individuals.

Whilst no attempt has officially been made to survey the language, and most current estimates are based off of historical surveys that prove to be inaccurate \cite{mitchellHowManyPeople2006}. It is estimated that there are over 1 million signers \cite{ethnologueAmericanSignLanguage2023}, but others estimates are as high as 2 million \cite{mitchellHowManyPeople2006}.
ASL communicates through a variety of means including gestures, non-manual markers and lexical signs. The most understood are lexical vocabulary, each corresponding to a word or morpheme. Gestures and non-manual markers such as facial expression can complement and convey more interactive or meaningful lexical signs. Additional constructs include usage of space, role shifting and classifiers.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Literature Identification}
This literature search was completed using the databases IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, and ScienceDirect. Search terms such as "ASL fingerspelling recognition", "Deep learning for ASL recognition",  "ASL recognition with CNN", "Accuracy of ASL recognition models", "Latest trends in ASL recognition", and "ASL recognition in real-time" were used alone and in conjunction with boolean operators "AND", "OR" to refine the search results. The search was limited to papers published in the last 5 years, and only peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, and high quality theses were considered. The search was also limited to papers written in English. The search was conducted in between November and December 2023, and the results were filtered to include only papers that were published between 2018 and 2023.
In addition to this search which was completed in order to find relevant literature for the model architecture comparison, we also used the references of the papers that we selected to find additional relevant literature, that dates further back in order to substantiate our historical context and technical background.
\subsection{Literature Evaluation}
Of the literature that fit out search criteria, we selected the most relevant papers based on the following criteria: the relevance to the research questions, papers that specifically address ASL fingerspelling, machine learning models in sign language interpretation, papers that used widely recognized datasets relevant to ASL recognition, we chose to exclude editorials, opinion pieces, and non-peer reviewed articles. Papers also required a clear methodology, defined objectives and robust data analysis. Papers with high citation counts were also given preference.

Only papers that were published the aim of a newly developed application of a model for sign language/fingerspelling for the first time between 2018 and 2023 were considered.

\begin{itemize}
    \item By understanding, the insight gained from this review will be used to inform the design and implementation of our own model.
    \item * evidence based approach is neccessary to be impactful *

\section{Historical Context (RQ-7)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide a brief overview of the evolution of ASL fingerspelling recognition.
    \item Highlight key milestones and breakthroughs in the field's history.
    \item Connect historical developments to current trends and future directions.
\end{itemize}
Early approaches to sign language recognition used robotic like data/power gloves which were wired, with sensors to capture hand movements and gestures \cite{saeedSystematicReviewSystemsBased2022}. They aimed to record the finger position and flexion in order to classify shapes. These approaches were limited by the need for specialized hardware and the inability to capture facial expressions and other non-manual markers. Rule-based classifiers did the legwork by detecting specific input pattern of sensors to an output by programmatic rules. This approach was not practical or user-friendly.

% early Machine learning
The move to machine learning was occuring in parallel to the hardware based approaches, as
vision-based approaches were developed to overcome the limitations of the hardware based approaches and was instrumental in the development of sign language recognition. This approach used computer vision techniques to detect and track the hand and fingers. They were able to capture more information than the hardware based approaches, but were limited by the need for a controlled environment and the inability to capture facial expressions and other non-manual markers, just as the hardware based approaches were. At this stage, there were no large datasets developed, and the datasets that were available were not standardized, and were not publicly available. The vocabulary was relatively small \cite{vonagrisRecentDevelopmentsVisual2008}, which meant that the recognition was limited to a small number of signs. The recognition was also limited to a single signer, and was not robust to variations in lighting, hand orientation, and background noise.

A great deal of focus was on feature extraction and classification, various algorithms were being pursued to extract hand features like posture. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used to solve this temporal sequential task, where each sign or gesture is defined by the transition from one state to another. HMMs use the transition state to understand meaning. This approach was limited by the need for a large amount of data to train the model \cite{vonagrisRecentDevelopmentsVisual2008}.

Another leap with vision was the usage of support vector machines (SVMs) to together with HMMs to enhance classification. SVMs were more effective at classifying spatial features such as hand shape and geolocation of digits, and videos that have depth, where gestures or shapes could look similar in 2D or 3D \cite{voglerParallelHiddenMarkov1999a}.

% Machine learning
As we move around the late 00's, a significant feat was neural networks such as used in \cite{munibAmericanSignLanguage2007b}, which used a 3-layer network with backpropagation and Hough transform. Although 92.3\% accuracy was achieved, this was still comparable to models using SVMs and HMMs, as well as the hardware based approaches before. The dataset was still limiting, with" 300 samples of hand sign images; 15 images for each sign." \cite{munibAmericanSignLanguage2007b}.

Perhaps the greatest leap was the rise of deep learning, as neural networks got deeper in terms of model layering. Image and video processing research as a whole was in full swing, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNS), and Long short-term memory (LSTMS), were a few which had significant impact. CNNs were adept at automatically extracting and learning

% Deep learning

Yann Lecun is credited with setting the precedence of CNNs in 1998, with the LeNet-5 architecture \cite{lecunGradientbasedLearningApplied1998}. This was a significant leap in the field of computer vision, and was the first time that a model was able to learn features automatically, which is why due to greatly increased GPU processing power, CNNs came back into the fold at the 2012 ImageNet challenge \cite{krizhevskyImageNetClassificationDeep2012}. CNNs are ideal and particularly adept at processing data that is grid-like, as in images that have dimensions.  A series of layers are used to extract and identify features by breaking down the image into smaller parts, understanding that, and over and over, and combining them to understand the whole image. Functions and pooling layers are used to optimize the output for classification.

RNNs are a type of neural network that are adept at processing sequential data, such as text, audio, and video. They are able to remember previous inputs and use that information recurrently, because the network has a directed cycle network, meaning information can persist inside the network \cite{sherstinskyFundamentalsRecurrentNeural2020}. This is particularly useful for ASL recognition, as the signs are sequential, and the order of the signs is important.

LSTMs are a type of RNN that are able to remember information for long periods of time, and are able to overcome the vanishing gradient problem that is common in RNNs \cite{sherstinskyFundamentalsRecurrentNeural2020}.

% Kinect and other hardware is more frameworky?

While these models and approaches were valid for challenge of American Sign Language, commonly fingerspelling isn't factored in, and these model types struggle to perform well on fingerspelling. This is because fingerspelling is a sequential task, and the order of the signs is important.

Currently, the experimental methods are Connectionist Temporal Classification \cite{gravesConnectionistTemporalClassification2006a, shiAmericanSignLanguage2018}, Attention \cite{bahdanauNeuralMachineTranslation2016}, Transformers \cite{vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023}, and using language models to improve accuracy.
