\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item why is this topic (ASL) important? (e.g., accessibility, communication)
    \item what is the specific problem being addressed? (e.g., fingerspelling recognition) (bridges the gap in communication and enhances the learning/usage of ASL.) (makes ai more accessible to this audience?)
    \item what is the impact of an AI recogniser for this problem? (e.g., enables real-time communication, improves accessibility, etc.) (can this effect broader technology?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Purpose}

\begin{itemize}
