\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item why is this topic (ASL) important? (e.g., accessibility, communication)

    \item what is the specific problem being addressed? (e.g., fingerspelling recognition) (bridges the gap in communication and enhances the learning/usage of ASL.) (makes ai more accessible to this audience?)
          ASL ,
    \item what is the impact of an AI recognizer for this problem? (e.g., enables real-time communication, improves accessibility, etc.) (can this effect broader technology?)
\end{itemize}

Sign language is the primary form of communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community. It allows communication when the spoken language is not possible, and or when the speaker or receiver is deaf or hard of hearing.
Depending on the situation, and like any language, it requires both parties to be fluent in the language to communicate effectively. However, this is not always the case. American Sign Language(ASL) is a complete, complex language that employs signs made with the hands and other movements, including facial expressions and postures of the body, and is used natively in the
United States of America and globally by many individuals. Whilst no attempt has officially been made to survey the language, and most current estimates are based off of historical surveys that prove to be inaccurate\cite{mitchellHowManyPeople2006}. It is estimated that there are over 1 million signers\cite{AmericanSignLanguage}, but others estimates are as high as 2 million\cite{mitchellHowManyPeople2006}.
ASL communicates through a variety of means including gestures, non-manual markers and lexical signs. The most understood are lexical vocabulary, each corresponding to a word or morpheme. Gestures and non-manual markers such as facial expression can complement and convey more interactive or meaningful lexical signs. Additional constructs include usage of space, role shifting and classifiers.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Literature Identification}
This literature search was completed using the databases IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, and ScienceDirect. Search terms such as "ASL fingerspelling recognition", "Deep learning for ASL recognition",  "ASL recognition with CNN", "Accuracy of ASL recognition models", "Latest trends in ASL recognition", and "ASL recognition in real-time" were used alone and in conjunction with boolean operators "AND", "OR" to refine the search results. The search was limited to papers published in the last 5 years, and only peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, and high quality theses were considered. The search was also limited to papers written in English. The search was conducted in November 2023, and the results were filtered to include only papers that were published between 2018 and 2023.
\subsection{Literature Evaluation}
Of the literature that fit out search criteria, we selected the most relevant papers based on the following criteria: the relevance to the research questions, papers that specifically address ASL fingerspelling, machine learning models in sign language interpretation, papers that used widely recognized datasets relevant to ASL recognition, we chose to exclude editorials, opinion pieces, and non-peer reviewed articles. Papers also required a clear methodology, defined objectives and robust data analysis. Papers with high citation counts were also given preference.
